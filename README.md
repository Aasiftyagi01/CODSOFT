# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses the famous Titanic dataset to build a Machine Learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not. It is one of the most iconic beginner-friendly problems in data science and is often used to practice data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification techniques.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains information about passengers, such as:
- Name
- Age
- Gender
- Passenger class (Pclass)
- Fare
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp)
- Number of parents/children aboard (Parch)
- Port of Embarkation
- Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
